ASSISTv4 is the final stable version of the ASSIST software. To our knowledge
there are no bugs present. We welcome your feedback, comments and bug reports.

One feature to pay attention to is how latitude and longitude are input in
ASSIST. There is an option to input degrees, minutes and seconds. You can input
decimal degrees by only using the degrees input box. To input degrees and
minutes, you can input minutes with fractional decimal places but pay attention
to only enter degrees in whole numbers. If you input degrees, minutes and
seconds ensure that degrees and minutes are given in whole numbers with no
fractional values. It is a feature of ASSIST to convert the geographic
positions into decimal degrees.
