  #{link_to 'Ice Watch', 'http://iarc.uaf.edu/icewatch'} is coordinating the collection and archival of visual sea ice observations
  recorded on ships in the Northern Hemisphere. We provide open source software for
  recording and sharing shipborne Arctic sea ice observation data. Data can also
  be collected in the Southern Hemisphere, and if submitted here will be passed to
  the Australian Antarctic Division database for #{link_to 'ASPeCt', 'http://aspect.antarctica.gov.au'}
  observations. Ice Watch is coordinated by the #{link_to 'University of Alaska Fairbanks', 'http://www.uaf.edu'},
  the #{link_to 'International Arctic Research Center', 'http://www.iarc.uaf.edu'},
  and the #{link_to 'Geographic Information Network of Alaska', 'http://www.gina.alaska.edu'}.
  The #{link_to 'Climate of the Cryosphere (CliC)', 'http://www.climate-cryosphere.org/index.php/activities/groups/164-arctic-sea-ice-wg'}
  office provides support for our international collaboration and networking.

  #{link_to 'ASSIST (Arctic Shipborne Sea Ice Standardization Tool) software', page_url('assist')}
  is used by observers to record sea ice conditions throughout the Arctic Ocean.
  During the summer melt season when most ship activity occurs, international
  vessels using ASSIST report near real-time observations of ice concentration,
  ice type, and distribution of multi-year ice to the Ice Watch team, who present
  the observations on this website.

  Cruise data in multiple formats are available to download for further analysis.
  The data archive will continue to grow as more ships participate and historic
  cruise data are converted to the ASSIST file format.

  ASSIST and the Ice Watch campaign debuted in summer 2012. We welcome feedback
  regarding your experiences with the Ice Watch site and the ASSIST software,
  which is freely available upon request. We also encourage submission of shipborne
  sea ice observation data recorded by other methods.
